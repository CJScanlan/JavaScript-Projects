# JavaScript Projects
Projects I made for The Tech Academy utilizing basic HTML and CSS. 

## Projects:
* [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/CJScanlan/JavaScript-Projects/tree/master/TicTacToe)
* [Pizza Project](https://github.com/CJScanlan/JavaScript-Projects/tree/master/Pizza_Project)
* [Calculator](https://github.com/CJScanlan/JavaScript-Projects/blob/master/JavaScript%20Projects/calculator.html)

### Tic Tac Toe
Here Javascript, HTML, and CSS are utilized to create a functioning tic tac toe game, where the player plays against the computer. The computer's moves are randomized based on which tiles are available for play. The first player to reach 3 in a row triggers a winning line across the pieces, as well as a Halloween themed sound! If neither player wins 3 in a row, a sound is triggered and the game restarts.  

### Pizza Project
This is a basic one-page website for a pseudo pizza shop. Here, a selection of pizza sizes and toppings are displayed. The user builds their pizza, and the price is calculated according to their choices. 

### Calculator
This is a basic calculator utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Basic math operations are programmed into the calculator, and each button corresponds to a number input and function. The calculator is built using a grid layout, and styled with CSS.
